Dear All,					March 2014

I am pleased to announce this newest release of my cnet network simulator.
cnet v3.3.1 enables experimentation with a variety of data-link layer,
network layer, and transport layer networking protocols in networks
consisting of any combination of wide-area-networking (WAN),
local-area-networking (LAN), or wireless-local-area-networking (WLAN) links.

cnet runs on a variety of Linux/UNIX platforms, and Apple's Mac-OSX
v10.4 and beyond. It does not run Windows.  The full distribution
(about 2.9MB) includes all source code, Makefiles, documentation,
and a few representative protocol examples, and is freely available
under the GNU General Public Licence v2 from:

    http://www.csse.uwa.edu.au/cnet/

A quick overview, including some screenshots, may be found at:

The main improvements of this main version are:

    - cnet and its protocols are now written in ISO-C99, and the new
      <stdint.h> and <stdbool.h> facilities are used wherever possible
    - use of 64-bit datatypes to manage time in microseconds
    - cnet now running on Mac-OSX, requiring XQuartz
    - much improved documentation
    - new WLAN link types, supported by specification and runtime
      modification of state, Tx and Rx power, loss, gain, sensitivity,
      signal-to-noise, current draw, received signal-strength and angle
      of arrival.
    - mobile nodes may determine position and move around the simulation map
    - simplified access to the Tck/Tk interface to draw on simulation map
    - addition of a (growing) support API of frequently-required functions

This announcement will hopefully arrive in time for you to consider
cnet's new features for your next teaching semester or term.

A big thanks to all those who continue to contribute to cnet with
ideas and bug finding, including students from The University of
Western Australia and Dartmouth College.  Since being cited in
Stalling's "Data and Computer Communications", 7th ed., the interest
has been a bit overwhelming, and it's taken a bit too long to release
this next version.  Thanks also to the ACM-SIGCSE and the Australian
Apple University Consortium for both supporting this work.

As ever, feedback about your use of cnet in your teaching is welcomed.
